## 📌 Overview
This repository is a **demo project inspired by my full-time work at Accenture (2021–2024)**.  
While I cannot share client code, this repo **recreates similar responsibilities, architectures, and workflows** that I contributed to during my role as a Full Stack Developer.  

The goal is to **demonstrate my expertise in building secure, scalable, and cloud-native applications** using modern full-stack practices.
